# Backtracking Algorithms

**Backtracking** is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).

## Included Algorithms
-   **Hamiltonian Cycle**: finding a cycle visiting every vertex exactly once.
-   **N-Queens Problem**: placing N queens on an NxN chessboard.
-   **Subset Sum**: finding whether a subset of integers sums to a target value.
-   **Sudoku Solver**: filling a 9x9 grid.
