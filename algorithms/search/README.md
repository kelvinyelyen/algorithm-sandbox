# Search Algorithms

**Searching Algorithms** are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.

## Included Algorithms
-   **Linear Search**: Simple sequential search. O(n).
-   **Binary Search**: Efficient search on sorted arrays. O(log n).
-   **Interpolation Search**: Improved binary search for uniformly distributed data. O(log(log n)).
