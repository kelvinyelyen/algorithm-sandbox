# Linear Search

## What is it?
**Linear Search** is the simplest search algorithm. It checks every element in the list sequentially until the target element is found or the list takes end.

## How it works
1.  Start from the first element.
2.  Compare the current element with the target.
3.  If they match, return the index.
4.  If not, move to the next element.
5.  If the end of the list is reached, the target is not present.

## Complexity
- **Time**: **O(n)**.
- **Space**: **O(1)**.

## Example Usage
```bash
python3 linear_search.py
```
