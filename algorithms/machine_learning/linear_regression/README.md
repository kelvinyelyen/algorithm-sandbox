# Linear Regression

## What is it?
**Linear Regression** is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables).

## How it works
It attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable.
Equation: `y = mx + c` (for simple linear regression).
Goal: Find `m` and `c` that minimize the sum of squared errors.

## Complexity
- **Time**: **O(N)** for training (Closed form).
- **Space**: **O(1)** (for model parameters).

## Example Usage
```bash
python3 linear_regression.py
```
