# Selection Sort

## What is it?
**Selection Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end.

## How it works
1.  Find the minimum element in the unsorted subarray.
2.  Swap it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted subarray.
3.  Move the boundary between sorted and unsorted subarrays one element to the right.

## Complexity
- **Time**: **O(n^2)**.
- **Space**: **O(1)**.

## Example Usage
```bash
python3 selection_sort.py
```
