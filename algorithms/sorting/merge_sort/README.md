# Merge Sort

## What is it?
**Merge Sort** is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.

## How it works
1.  **Divide**: Divide the array into two halves.
2.  **Conquer**: Recursively sort the two halves.
3.  **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.

## Complexity
- **Time**: **O(n log n)**.
- **Space**: **O(n)**.

## Example Usage
```bash
python3 merge_sort.py
```
