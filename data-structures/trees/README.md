# Trees

## What is it?
A **Tree** is a non-linear data structure representing a hierarchy. It consists of nodes and edges.

## Common Types
-   **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most 2 children.
-   **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Left < Root < Right.
-   **AVL Tree**: Self-balancing BST.
-   **Red-Black Tree**: Self-balancing BST with coloring rules.
-   **B-Tree**: Self-balancing search tree where nodes can have >2 children (used in databases).

## Complexity (BST)
-   **Access/Search/Insert/Delete**: **O(log N)** avg, **O(N)** worst.

## Example Usage
```bash
python3 binary_tree.py
python3 binary_search_tree.py
python3 avl_tree.py
```
