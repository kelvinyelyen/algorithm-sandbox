# Arrays

## What is it?
An **Array** is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.

## Basic Operations
-   **Traverse**: Iterate through elements (O(N)).
-   **Insertion**: Convert dynamic array, can be O(N) if shifting needed.
-   **Deletion**: O(N) due to shifting.
-   **Search**: O(N) linear search, O(1) if index known.

## Example Usage
```bash
python3 array_operations.py
```
