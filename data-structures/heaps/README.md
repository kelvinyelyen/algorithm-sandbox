# Heaps

## What is it?
A **Heap** is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.
-   **Max-Heap**: Key at root must be maximum.
-   **Min-Heap**: Key at root must be minimum.

## Use Cases
-   Priority Queues.
-   Heap Sort.
-   Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, Prim).

## Complexity
-   **Insert**: **O(log N)**.
-   **Delete Min/Max**: **O(log N)**.
-   **Get Min/Max**: **O(1)**.

## Example Usage
```bash
python3 heap.py
```
