# Linked Lists

## What is it?
A **Linked List** is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

## Types
-   **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to next.
-   **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to next and previous.
-   **Circular Linked List**: Last node points to first.

## Complexity
-   **Access**: **O(N)**.
-   **Insert/Delete**: **O(1)** (if iterator/pointer known).

## Example Usage
```bash
python3 singly_linked_list.py
python3 doubly_linked_list.py
```
